## Customer Service / Presales

Customer service and pre-sales departments are currently experiencing scale issues due to the high call volumes. The organization wants to support the customer services staff in handling the call volumes through the implementation of chat bots in which future bicycle owners can:
- Find which bicycle is best for them:
    - Through a set of questions with the chat bot, custom recommendations are given to potential bike owners, who then can take the recommendation and place an order, or can be redirect to a sales specialist to help them with their needs
- Check status on current orders:
    - Retrieve status on current orders, and estimated delivery times
- Find bicycle parts suitable for their existing bicycle:
    - Existing bicycle owners can find recommended bicycle parts and accessories based on the serial number or model number of their bicycle
    - Existing bicycle owners, can upload a picture of their bicycle or take a picture of the serial number of their bicycle to assist with the identification of their bicycle and have recommended bicycle parts

Over the last few years the customer services departments have observed an increase in calls from fraudulent customer who are asking for support for bikes that are no longer in warranty, or bikes that have not even been purchased at AdventureWorks. The department are currently relying on the experience of customer services agents to identify this. As a result, they would like to implement a system that can help the agents track in real-time who could be making a fraudulent claim.

Finally, given its global expansion, the customer service / presales chat bot needs to respond to requests for data in near real-time regardless of where the customer is located. The chatbot should also support multiple languages such as Dutch, German, French, English, Spanish, and Japanese. This work will be handled by the AI Engineers, but they have requested a platform is provided by the Data Engineer that enables them to store conversation history.
